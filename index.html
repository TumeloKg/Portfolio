          I am a young and self-motivated Software Engineering graduate with an
          Honors Degree in Computing specializing in Software Engineering. I am
          not only a dedicated and focused individual, I am also result oriented
          always striving to do my best as evidenced by my performance in my
          studies as well as in projects I have been engaged with. <br />
          During my studies, I was honored with the Deans Award for the
          outstanding performance. During the industry practice, I designed a
          software that assisted in the business processes of the organisation I
          was attached to as a self initiative. At a personal level I have
          designed websites for various local SMMEs. I am an individual who is
          always looking for ways of creating solutions, in the form of
          applications/business systems to address challenges I see in my
          environment. <br />
          My overall goal therefore is to make meaningful impact to the
          organisation I work for through application of my skills and
          knowledge. I have special skills in Programming in C#,ASP.Net and
          Visual Studio, JAVA; Full stack Web Development with skills in
          HTML,CSS,PHP and JavaScript, Database Management in SQL and Oracle, as
          well as Android Application Development.
